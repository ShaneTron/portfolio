    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <h3> I grew us in an Airforce family so we traveled a lot throughout my younger years. I feel this made my a stronger persone since I was always having to adjust to new environments every two or three years. Although I was not born or spend much of my youth in Washigton. I do consider myself from the area. Both my mother and father were born in the PNW and most of my extended family lives in the area. I have lived in the city of Seattle for over ten year. Previous to living in the City, I lived 45 minutes south in the city of Lakewood. I spent much of my younger years there.
       I first moved to Seattle to attend culinary school.
